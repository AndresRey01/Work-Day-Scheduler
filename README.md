# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description
This Work Day Scheduler allows users to have an easier time on planning their work day. The user can document upcoming events on the scheduler, and the scheduler will update them on either if the event is still upcoming, soon that day, or if it has passed, with color coding; grey indicates past, red indicates present, and green indicates future.
